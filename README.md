# Rift's Character Quiz

This is for a programming course.

This quiz game will help determine how big of a weeb you are.

You have to write the name of the anime/manga/light-novel character, whose image is shown. The answer isn't case sensitive and it doesn't matter if you write the last name before or after the first name (e.g. Akashiya Moka / Moka Akashiya), both are correct (characters with multiple names are an exception).

## Modding

You can add/remove characters to/from this game by adding/removing their image files in the /Assets/Images/Characters/ folder. The character's image should be named after the character (e.g. Sung Jin-Woo > jin-woo_sung.png). The image should be 230x345 pixels in size for the best outcome.

You can add/remove background music to/from this game by adding/removing audio files in the /Assets/Audio/ folder. Only the audio files supported by pygame will work.
