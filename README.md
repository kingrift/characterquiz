# Rift's Character Quiz

This is for a programming course.

This quiz game will help determine how big of a weeb you are.

You have to write the name of the anime/manga/light-novel character, whose image is shown. The answer isn't case sensitive and it doesn't matter if you write the last name before or after the first name (ex. Akashiya Moka / Moka Akashiya), both are correct (characters with multiple names are an exception).
